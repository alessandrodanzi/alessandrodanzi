#Copernicus dataset
#4 main areas
#sentinel2: satellite with resolution of 10m
#VEGETATION
#LAI=leaf area index. the higher it is the higher is the photosynthesis
#FCOVER is related. An idea for the exam is to see the correlation of the variables during the same day
#FAPAR: how much of the radiation from the sun is retained by plants to do photosynthesis
#NDVI: different vegetation index (NIR reflecting and red absorbing. normalized index is difference between them)
#VCI= vegetation condition, if you have temporal changes. 
#VPI=vegetation productivity index. how much vegetation is producing (agricultual power), both biomass and fruits
#Dry matter: biomass without the water. idea of how much the vegetation is growing
#burnt area: both human related and natural.
#soil water index: measures the moisture of soil. 
#surface soil moisture: only in the very first part of soil horizon, important for first new colonization
#3 variables for ENERGY: albedo, reflectance, soil temperature
#WATER CYCLE: 
#surface water temperature, 
#water quality (amount of nutrients, clorophyll, ...) 
#water bodies (inland water) max and min extent, seasonal dynamics
#water level (hight of the water respect to sealevel)
#CRYOSPHERE:
#lake ice extent
#snow cover
#snow water equivalent
